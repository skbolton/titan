# MBSYNC Configuration

# There are two big ideas in mbsync `Stores` and `Channels`
# `Stores` define a collection of mailboxes, basically folders, either local or remote
# `Channels` connect two Stores and describe how they are synchronized
#
# There are two auxiliary objects: `Accounts` and `Groups`
# `Accounts` describes the connection part of Network `Stores` - Allowing the sharing of
# configurations between `Stores`
# `Groups` meanwhile aggregate multiple `Channels` together to save typing at the command
# line. Basically syncing the `Group` to sync all `Channels` of that `Group`.

# Global Options
# Defing these outside of a Store applies to all of them

# Suggested by Manual pages - follow folder layout exactly on sync
Subfolders Verbatim
# Where this store exists

# BOTM Channel
# Since Fastmail labels are pretty straightforward I just 
# let all the folders on the remote get created locally
