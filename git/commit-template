# Title: Summary, imperative, Capital starting, don't end with period
# No more than 50 chars. Which is less than this  |

# Remember the blank between the title and body

# Body: Explain *what* and *why* not *how*

# Space between Body and Footer

# Footer: Project metadata (area, ticket hash, related)

# Great example commit
# Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
# 
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
# line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
# the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
# two together.
# 
# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
# or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
# by commands like git merge and git revert.
# 
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
# 
# - Bullet points are okay, too
# 
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
#   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
# 
# - Use a hanging indent
# 
# If you use an issue tracker, add a reference(s) to them at the bottom,
# like so:
# 
# Resolves: #123
